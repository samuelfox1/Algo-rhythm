>## Description 

* A collection of algorithm challenges and test writing to cover basic function and possible edge cases.

* #### Story
    * AS A: Developer
    * I WANT: To practice my algorithm challenges and test writing with the Jest framework
    * SO THAT: I can inprove my problem solving and test writing skills

3. run 'npm i' to install npm dependencies
4. run 'npm test' to verify all current tests are passing

<br>

>## Usage

1. Choose an algorithm to work on and navigate to direcory `./<folder-name>`
2. Checkout the README.md in the directory to understand the challenge.
3. Write code in `<algorithm-name>.js` to solve the challenge, write test suites in `<algorithm-name>.test.js` to verify the algorithm passes any edge cases you can think of.
2. Run npm test `<filename>`.test.js to run the test suite and verify the algorithm and test suite pass as expected.
