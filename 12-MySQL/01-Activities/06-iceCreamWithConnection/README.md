# **Instructions**

* Throughout this class we are going to be working on creating an application that takes in music data to create personalized playlists. 

* Create your `playlistDB` database in MySQL.

**Remember, you must create a database before attempting to connect to it. Doing otherwise will return an error.**

* Create a new file and name it `playlistConnection.js`.

* Create a connection to the database using Node.js.

* BONUS: Using MySQL Workbench, create a table in your database with four columns.

  * Primary Key of "ID" which auto-increments
  * A column called "title"
  * A column called "artist"
  * A column called "genre"

* BONUS: Using MySQL Workbench, populate your table with a few rows of dummy data
